    Linear Feedback Shift Registers for GNU Guile
  -------------------------------------------------

This  library  contains  two  scheme   modules  targetted  at  GNU  Guile.  The
(communication  lfsr)  module implements  linear  feedback  shift registers  as
infinite  streams of  bits.  LFSRs  are used,  for  example,  to generate  chip
sequences  in CDMA  systems, for  synchronising preambles  or as  pseudo random
number generators.

The (communication  gps-ca) module,  which uses  the former  implements streams
that  produce pseudo  random gold  chip sequences  as used  in C/A  of the  GPS
satellite system.

To run the test-suite of the library, the following additional dependencies are
required:
